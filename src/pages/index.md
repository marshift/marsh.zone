# the marsh zone
hey there, i'm marsh! welcome to my little website.

## "who are you?"
on the internet, i go by "marsh" - but you can find me on most socials under the alias "marshift".
i'm a self-taught software developer and general technology witch, as well as a so-so vocalist, and professional silly girl.

## "how do you spend your time, marsh?"
i program things - and sometimes they even work! my favourite programming language is TypeScript - but i'm partial to JavaScript, Python, and a plethora of others, too.
if not for that, you can probably find me hanging around in [various virtual reality spaces](//vrchat.com).

## "woah, your website is really cool! how did you make it?"
thank you! this website is built with [astro](//astro.build), [unocss](//unocss.dev) and a whole lotta code.
it would not have turned out as cool as it did if not for [these lovely things](/credits).
