# marsh's zone
hey there, i'm marsh! welcome to my little website.

## "who are you?"
generally, i go by "marsh" - but you can likely find me across the world wide web under the alias "marshift".
i'm a self-taught software developer, general technology witch as well as a so-so vocalist.

## "how do you spend your time, marsh?"
i program things - and sometimes they even work! my favourite programming language is TypeScript - but i'm partial to JavaScript, Python, and a plethora of others, too.
if not for that, you can probably find me hanging around in [various virtual reality spaces](//vrchat.com).
